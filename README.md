## Overview

The **Auto-Emoji Replacer** integration listens for messages sent from Telex and processes them by replacing specific words with corresponding Unicode emojis (from a database of 200+ emojis). The modified message is then returned to the Telex channel. This integration adheres to Telexâ€™s modifier integration requirements by exposing a POST endpoint that accepts a JSON payload.

- **Lightweight and Efficient:** Minimal processing overhead for fast responses, even under high load.
